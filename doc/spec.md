This page will serve as a directoy of specs for the new Spn.ee system.

We have all decided that the customer token that serves as our authentication
system will be project based.  Meaning that for each project inside of a customer
account id we will have a different token.

Account 1, Project 1, Token X11
Account 1, Project 2, Token X12

Account 2, Project 1, Token X21
Account 2, Project 2, Token X22
